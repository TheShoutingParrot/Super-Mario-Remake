# Super Mario Remake in C with SDL

# Dependencies
* SDL2
* SDL(2) image

# Installing
The original code was developed with gcc 4.5.2 under windows and wasn't tested with linux/mac. This is completely the opposite, it has been tested with linux/max and hasn't been tested on windows (yet). You can try installing it by running "make windows"
